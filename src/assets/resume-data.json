  "summary": "I am a dedicated and adaptable full-stack developer with over nine years of experience working on diverse and impactful projects. My journey in software development has allowed me to touch every part of the stack—backend, frontend, and mobile—and contribute to creating end-to-end solutions that are both efficient and user-friendly.\n\nOn the backend, I have extensive experience with Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful APIs, building scalable and secure systems to power robust applications. My work often involves database design and management, leveraging technologies like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and TimescaleDB to ensure reliability and performance.\n\nOn the frontend, I have developed clean, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces using React.js, Angular, and modern design principles. I take pride in ensuring the user experience is seamless, accessible, and aligned with business goals.\n\nFor mobile development, I have worked on native Android applications using Kotlin and Java and have delivered cross-platform solutions using Flutter. My projects have included everything from task management apps to fintech solutions, each requiring a mix of creativity, technical expertise, and attention to detail.\n\nWhat sets me apart is my curiosity and eagerness to explore new technologies and methodologies. I thrive on learning, whether it's diving into the latest tools, exploring cutting-edge frameworks, or tackling domains I haven't worked in before.\n\nSome career highlights include:\n✨ Leading full-stack projects from concept to deployment, ensuring quality and scalability.\n✨ Developing secure payment systems and POS applications, integrating APIs, and optimizing performance.\n✨ Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver user-focused solutions.\n✨ Mentoring junior developers and fostering a culture of continuous learning.",
